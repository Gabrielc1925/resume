    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Family</h2>
        <p>Alhamduillah, I am blessed to have been happily married for over a decade.</p>
        <p>My wife and I have been blessed with 5 wonderful children insha'Allah, and I enjoy spending all my free time with them.  They are homeschooled, and so we spend all our days off going to parks and extra-curriculars to learn about different things.</p>
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I enjoy gardening, working with tools to build and fix things, and learning how to do new things</p>
        <p>I do Brazillian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) as often as I can, and my kids areenjoying learning it as well</p>
    <h2>Work</h2>
        <p>I went to school to be a pharmacist, and spent 7 years managing pharmacies for Walgreens</p>
        <p>I have wanted to work in tech my entire life, and I finally became so disenfranchised with the state of pharmacy and the danger we are placing people in (especially in the chain pharmacy setting) that I was convinced to take a leap and make the transition to start working in tech.</p>
        <p>After learning on my own for a while, I was introduced to a friend of a friend who was willing to mentor me.  Since then, I have been working to learn everything I can to prepare myself to take on a new role.</p>
