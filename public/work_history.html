    <h3>Managing pharmacies for Walgreens</h3>
        <p>I have worked for 7 years as a Pharmacy Manager for Walgreens.  After I graduated from University of New Mexico College of Pharmacy with a Doctorate of Pharmacy, I took a position as a pharmacy manager in Taos, NM.  I worked there for 4 years before moving to Denver.  In Denver, I managed two pharmacies for another 3 years.</p>
        <p>Working in a customer service role as a manager has taught me much about customer relations and how to train and direct others.  Many of the skills I learned there will be directly applicable to project management in the tech industry, and will help to ensure the smooth launch and successive rollout of applications.</p>
